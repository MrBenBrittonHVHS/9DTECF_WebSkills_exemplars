  <h1>Ben Britton</h1>
  <p>
Kia ora! My name is Ben Britton. I was born in Christchurch and grew up in Wellington. I live in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wainuiomata">Wainuomata</a>. I have two children who go to school in Wainuiomata. My family is from Canada, all my cousins, aunties, uncles and grandparents are there.
  </p>
  <p>
    I really enjoy using computers. I like programming, doing electronics projects and designing things for my 3D printer. I also like riding my bike. I ride to school whenever I can.
